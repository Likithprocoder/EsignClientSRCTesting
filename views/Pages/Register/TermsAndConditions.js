            will disclose personal information if it's necessary to comply with
            a legal obligation, prevent fraud, enforce an agreement, or protect
            our users' safety. We do not currently honor Do Not Track signals
            from internet browsers; when a universal standard for processing
            them emerges, we will follow it.
